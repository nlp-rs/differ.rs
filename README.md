A natural language processing library, written in Rust.

# *Brief overview*
### Crates
 - [x]  Differ:
   - [x]  `apply_diff`: Allows users to apply delta vectors in order to transform a words.
   - [x]  `extra_traits`: all `struct`s implemented in `differ-rs` are `HammingDistance` and `LevenshteinDistance`. Each Struct implements the `diff` and `distance` methods.
